                  We packed our bags and headed to the mountains to get married. We hiked to this beautiful lake 
                  in the mountains of East Glacier National Park to exchange vows with our daughter by our side. This 
                  is Saint Mary's Lake, the second largest lake in the park. The lake is tucked away between the majestic, 
                  steeply rising mountains on all sides. The trees stood tall with wild flowers bordering the banks that
                  reflected off the crystal clear waters.

                  Although the mountains made for a beautiful wedding, there are so many other reasons to visit this beautiful
                  state. After our wedding we explored as much as we could for the duration of our stay. I would highly recommend 
                  going in the summer or fall for perfect weather. We went in June, and experienced flooding that closed a major section
                  of the park causing us to change dates and locations for the wedding. There are still so many other beautiful
                  places away from the main attractions. Here we hiked the Bowman trail. We were a few miles from the Canadian border and it
                  was very difficult to get to. Polebridge was the only place for miles, tucked away in the middle of the mountains. There 
                  is tons of wildlife from elk, moose, and bears roaming freely in the praries. If you visit bring your bear spray! This hike 
                  was only a few miles through heavily wooded areas, crossing rushing rivers, and opening to this beautiful meadow full
                  of wildflowers.

               After leaving Polebridge we couldn't help to go deeper in to the mountains. Driving up gravel roads that hugged the side of 
               the mountains until we finally came to a trail head. This lake was the deepest we could get in the park. We were in the middle of 
               nowhere, with no other hikers, and no service yet we trecked along. We hiked straight up till the trail platued to this opening. Walking 
               through thick trees that stood so high you couldn't see the sky. Then this lake just appeared with mountains on every side and crystal 
               clear water. This was the most beautiful place I had ever seen. The reward of seeing this place definatly outweighed the long difficult 
               journey to get there.

               This was the best experience of my life. Although nothing went as planned, everything turned out perfect. When you're
               in a place like Glacier National Park, nothing could go wrong. After our ceremony, we hiked as high as we could to get 
               a look over the mountains and take it all in. It was just the two of us, our daughter, and our photographer. We popped a bottle
               of champaign and watched the sun fall over the mountains changing the blue skies to shades of blue and purple. This is a moment
               that I will never forget. I hope sharing my experience motivates you to visit, and let the experience change you like it did me.
